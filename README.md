# Pixel Brawl

**Pixel Brawl** is a fast-paced, top-down rogue-like dungeon crawler where shooting, dashing, and parrying are the primary mechanics. Players control a 2D character in a dynamic 2.5D environment, facing off against enemies, dodging non-pink bullets, and strategically parrying pink bullets to progress.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Combat Mechanics**:
  - **Shooting**: The core mechanic of *Pixel Brawl*. Players must shoot enemies to gain XP and unlock new rooms.
  - **Dashing**: Use dashes to quickly evade incoming attacks.
  - **Parrying**: Players can parry pink bullets, adding a tactical layer to combat. Successful parries reward bonus XP.

- **Procedurally Generated Rooms**: Each run features procedurally generated rooms, creating a unique experience. There are a limited number of rooms per run, and each room poses different challenges.

- **Progression**: 
  - Players earn XP by defeating enemies and can level up over multiple runs.
  - Destroying pink enemies or objects is required to unlock the next room.
  - Non-pink enemies are optional, but defeating them grants additional XP.
  
## Tactical Challenges

- **Unlocking Rooms**:
  - After clearing pink enemies, players can choose to either escape and keep half of their XP or proceed to the next room.
  - If a player proceeds but dies, they lose all XP gained in that run.
  - Defeating a boss allows the player to clear the stage and retain all XP earned in that stage.

- **Stat Points & Upgrades**:
  - Players start at level 1 with 3 stat points and gain 1 extra point per level.
  - Stat points are assigned before each run and can be distributed across the following attributes:
    - **Life**
    - **Movement Speed**
    - **Ricochet Amount** (3 points)
    - **Piercing Amount** (3 points)
    - **Jumps** (2 points)
    - **Dash Cooldown Reduction**
    - **Damage**
    - **Ammo Capacity** (larger magazine means less frequent reloading)

## Key Features

- **XP System**: Players earn XP based on enemy difficulty and successful parries of pink attacks.
- **Risk & Reward**: Balancing risk when deciding to proceed or escape a room is crucial to success.
- **Character Progression**: As players level up, they gain more stat points to distribute, allowing for strategic customization of each run.
- **Boss Battles**: Defeating bosses is essential to stage progression and securing all earned XP.
